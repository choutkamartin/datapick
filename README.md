# Datapick

Datapick is a tool for labelling raw data. These labelled data can be later used for a machine learning model. Datapick has been created as a bachelors project. Right now, this tool is not suitable for companies or teams looking for quick data label. However, you can fork it and modify - or you can use it as an inspiration.

If you want to learn more about Datapick and the process behind it, you can check out the blog page: [www.blog.datapick.tech](https://blog.datapick.tech/).
